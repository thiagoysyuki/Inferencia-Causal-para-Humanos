            The Synthetic Control Method (SCM) has become a widely used tool in both identifying and estimating the causal impact of policies, shocks, and interventions of interest on economic and social outcomes. The technique has become particularly popular in estimating the effect of these shocks on a single treated unit. As a transparent and data‐driven statistical technique, the goal of the SCM is to construct an artificial control group for the treated unit that has similar pretreatment characteristics but has not undergone the treatment itself thus developing a plausible counterfactual against which impacts resulting from structural changes can be evaluated as part of a historical investigation. The method works well when the control group balances pre‐intervention outcomes and auxiliary covariates as much as possible. In spite of its widespread adoption, the use of the SCM in comparative economic history has lagged behind other areas of economics. In this article, we critically review the properties of the SCM and discuss the necessary conditions for a plausible application of the technique to comparative economic history in support of research designed to answer some of the long‐running historical questions and demonstrate the potential to use SCM in comparative economic history studies by estimating the impact of the oil discovery in the 1920s on Venezuela's long‐term economic growth.},

	abstract = {To correctly evaluate the effects of treatments, conducting randomized controlled trials (RCTs) is a reasonable approach. However, because it is generally difficult to implement RCTs for all treatments, methods to estimate the treatment effects using observational data have been actively studied and used in various decision-making processes. Observational data accumulated in business activities and elsewhere contains the results of various previously implemented treatments, and correctly estimating the effects of any given treatment without separating the impacts of other treatments is challenging. Against this background, this paper proposes a method to estimate the effects of multiple treatments of various types while considering various causal relationships. Specifically, the proposal is a variational inference method that estimates the effect of multiple treatments using four latent factors estimated from observations, making assumptions that are independent of the type and number of treatments. The proposed method makes it possible to appropriately estimate the effects of measures even in situations with complex causal relationships. In addition, in situations where measures with continuous parameters are being implemented, it is possible to estimate the effects of measures that have not been implemented in the past by treating the content of the measures as a continuous variable.},

	abstract = {This paper summarizes recent advances in causal inference and underscores the paradigmatic shifts that must be undertaken in moving from traditional statistical analysis to causal analysis of multivariate data. Special emphasis is placed on the assumptions that underlie all causal inferences, the languages used in formulating those assumptions, the conditional nature of all causal and counterfactual claims, and the methods that have been developed for the assessment of such claims. These advances are illustrated using a general theory of causation based on the Structural Causal Model (SCM) described in Pearl (2000a), which subsumes and uniﬁes other approaches to causation, and provides a coherent mathematical foundation for the analysis of causes and counterfactuals. In particular, the paper surveys the development of mathematical tools for inferring (from a combination of data and assumptions) answers to three types of causal queries: those about (1) the effects of potential interventions, (2) probabilities of counterfactuals, and (3) direct and indirect effects (also known as “mediation”). Finally, the paper deﬁnes the formal and conceptual relationships between the structural and potential-outcome frameworks and presents tools for a symbiotic analysis that uses the strong features of both. The tools are demonstrated in the analyses of mediation, causes of effects, and probabilities of causation.},

To that end, we formally define causal interventions and their effects over time on discrete-time stochastic processes (DSPs). Then, we show under which conditions the equilibrium states of a DSP, both before and after a causal intervention, can be captured by a structural causal model (SCM). With such an equivalence at hand, we provide an explicit mapping from vector autoregressive models (VARs), broadly applied in econometrics, to linear, but potentially cyclic and/or affected by unmeasured confounders, SCMs. The resulting causal VAR framework allows us to perform causal inference over time from observational time series data. Our experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that the proposed framework achieves strong performance in terms of observational forecasting while enabling accurate estimation of the causal effect of interventions on dynamical systems. We demonstrate, through a case study, the potential practical questions that can be addressed using the proposed causal VAR framework.},

	abstract = {The propensity score is a common tool for estimating the causal effect of a binary treatment in observational data. In this setting, matching, subclassiﬁcation, imputation or inverse probability weighting on the propensity score can reduce the initial covariate bias between the treatment and control groups. With more than two treatment options, however, estimation of causal effects requires additional assumptions and techniques, the implementations of which have varied across disciplines. This paper reviews current methods, and it identiﬁes and contrasts the treatment effects that each one estimates. Additionally, we propose possible matching techniques for use with multiple, nominal categorical treatments, and use simulations to show how such algorithms can yield improved covariate similarity between those in the matched sets, relative the pre-matched cohort. To sum, this manuscript provides a synopsis of how to notate and use causal methods for categorical treatments.},

The field’s inherently interdisciplinary nature—particularly the central role of incorporating domain knowledge—creates a rich and varied set of statistical challenges. Much progress has been made, especially in the last three decades, but there remain many open questions. Our goal in this discussion is to outline research directions and open problems we view as particularly promising for future work. Throughout we emphasize that advancing causal research requires a wide range of contributions, from novel theory and methodological innovations to improved software tools and closer engagement with domain scientists and practitioners.},

We oﬀer a curated review of this methodological literature organized around the two most popular frameworks for the analysis and interpretation of RD designs: the continuity framework and the local randomization framework. For each framework, we discuss three main topics: (i) designs and parameters, which focuses on diﬀerent types of RD settings and treatment eﬀects of interest; (ii) estimation and inference, which presents the most popular methods based on local polynomial regression and analysis of experiments, as well as reﬁnements, extensions, and alternatives; and (iii) validation and falsiﬁcation, which summarizes an array of mostly empirical approaches to support the validity of RD designs in practice.},

Over the past several decades, three major frameworks have emerged to formalize causal questions and guide their analysis: the potential outcomes framework, structural equation models, and directed acyclic graphs. Although these frameworks differ in language, assumptions, and philosophical orientation, they often lead to compatible or complementary insights. This paper provides a comparative introduction to the three frameworks, clarifying their connections, highlighting their distinct strengths and limitations, and illustrating how they can be used together in practice. The discussion is aimed at researchers and graduate students with some background in statistics or causal inference who are seeking a conceptual foundation for applying causal methods across a range of substantive domains.},

Em contraste com a inferência estatística, que busca estimar parâmetros e extrapolá-los para a população, a inferência causal visa determinar se o parâmetro estimado reflete a relação de causa e efeito que se deseja analisar. O artigo apresenta o conceito de contrafactual como uma ferramenta crucial para abordar questões causais e chama a atenção para a inadequação de comparações intuitivas do tipo antes versus depois e afetados versus não afetados no exame de questões de natureza causal. O texto destaca a importância não apenas de dados e procedimentos estatísticos, mas também de hipóteses nem sempre empiricamente testáveis. O objetivo final é promover a compreensão de inferências causais válidas e identificar abordagens malsucedidas.},

Objective: the goal of this paper is to provide a tutorial that serves as practical guide for researchers considering using natural experiments to make causal inferences. Methods: we discuss the DiD advantages, concerns, and tests of validity. We also provide an application of the technique, in which we discuss the effect of government guarantees on banks’ degree of risk, using the 2008 financial crisis as a natural experiment. The database used, as well as the Stata and the R scripts containing the analyses, are available as online appendices. Conclusion: DiD may be used to tackle endogeneity concerns when treatment assignment is random.},

	abstract = {An important step when designing an empirical study is to justify the sample size that will be collected. The key aim of a sample size justification for such studies is to explain how the collected data is expected to provide valuable information given the inferential goals of the researcher. In this overview article six approaches are discussed to justify the sample size in a quantitative empirical study: 1) collecting data from (almost) the entire population, 2) choosing a sample size based on resource constraints, 3) performing an a-priori power analysis, 4) planning for a desired accuracy, 5) using heuristics, or 6) explicitly acknowledging the absence of a justification. An important question to consider when justifying sample sizes is which effect sizes are deemed interesting, and the extent to which the data that is collected informs inferences about these effect sizes. Depending on the sample size justification chosen, researchers could consider 1) what the smallest effect size of interest is, 2) which minimal effect size will be statistically significant, 3) which effect sizes they expect (and what they base these expectations on), 4) which effect sizes would be rejected based on a confidence interval around the effect size, 5) which ranges of effects a study has sufficient power to detect based on a sensitivity power analysis, and 6) which effect sizes are expected in a specific research area. Researchers can use the guidelines presented in this article, for example by using the interactive form in the accompanying online Shiny app, to improve their sample size justification, and hopefully, align the informational value of a study with their inferential goals.},
